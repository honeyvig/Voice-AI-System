# Voice-AI-System
To build a Voice AI system that can call clients, qualify leads, and schedule appointments with a finance manager, you can leverage various APIs and tools. Here, we'll be using Python and a combination of the following technologies:
Technologies and Tools:

    Twilio: For making and receiving voice calls.
    Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: For converting speech to text (transcribing the voice input).
    Dialogflow (or OpenAI GPT-3/ChatGPT): For natural language processing (NLP) and lead qualification.
    Twilio Studio: For creating a custom IVR (Interactive Voice Response) flow, which helps in qualifying leads.
    Calendly API or Google Calendar API: To schedule the appointment automatically.
    Flask or FastAPI: For backend integration.

The process involves:

    Calling clients via Twilio Voice API.
    Listening to the conversation and transcribing speech using Speech-to-Text.
    Using Dialogflow (or GPT-3) to interact and qualify the lead.
    Once the lead is qualified, scheduling an appointment with the finance manager.

Steps:

    Set up Twilio for voice calling.
    Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription.
    Use Dialogflow or GPT-3 for conversation.
    Integrate with Calendly or Google Calendar to schedule appointments.

Python Code Implementation:
Prerequisites:

    Install the required libraries:

    pip install twilio google-cloud-speech google-cloud-dialogflow Flask

    Set up:
        Twilio account and API keys (from Twilio Console).
        Google Cloud API credentials for Speech-to-Text and Dialogflow (from Google Cloud Console).

Python Code:

import os
from twilio.rest import Client
from google.cloud import speech
from google.cloud import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse

# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

# Dialogflow configuration
DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID = 'your_dialogflow_project_id'
DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_ID = 'unique_session_id'

# Flask setup for webhook
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Twilio client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Initialize Google Cloud clients
speech_client = speech.SpeechClient()

# Function to handle incoming call and collect responses
@app.route('/incoming-call', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def incoming_call():
    """Handle incoming call and initiate qualification process."""
    response = VoiceResponse()

    # Start a conversation with the client
    response.say("Hello, this is a quick qualification call. Please answer a few questions.")
    
    # Use gather to collect input from the client
    gather = response.gather(input='speech', timeout=5, speech_model='phone_call', action='/handle-response')
    gather.say("Are you interested in financing a new vehicle? Press 1 for Yes, 2 for No.")

    return str(response)

# Function to handle the client's response and qualify the lead
@app.route('/handle-response', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def handle_response():
    """Process client's response and qualify the lead."""
    response = VoiceResponse()

    # Get the speech input from the gather step
    speech_input = request.values.get('SpeechResult')

    if speech_input:
        # Send speech input to Dialogflow for qualification processing
        lead_qualification = qualify_lead_with_dialogflow(speech_input)

        # If the lead is qualified, schedule an appointment
        if lead_qualification == 'qualified':
            response.say("Great! Let's schedule an appointment with our finance manager.")
            response.redirect('/schedule-appointment')
        else:
            response.say("Thank you for your time. We will follow up with you later.")
            response.hangup()

    return str(response)

# Function to qualify the lead with Dialogflow or GPT-3
def qualify_lead_with_dialogflow(speech_input):
    """Qualify lead using Dialogflow."""
    session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
    session = session_client.session_path(DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID, DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_ID)

    text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(text=speech_input, language_code="en")
    query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)

    # Send the text input to Dialogflow
    response = session_client.detect_intent(session=session, query_input=query_input)

    # Analyze Dialogflow response
    if response.query_result.intent.display_name == 'Lead Qualified':
        return 'qualified'
    else:
        return 'unqualified'

# Function to schedule an appointment (using Google Calendar API or Calendly API)
@app.route('/schedule-appointment', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def schedule_appointment():
    """Schedule an appointment with the finance manager."""
    response = VoiceResponse()
    
    response.say("Please provide your preferred date and time for the appointment.")
    
    # In a real system, you would schedule this with Google Calendar or Calendly API
    # Here we assume the appointment is scheduled directly.
    response.say("Your appointment has been scheduled. Thank you.")

    return str(response)

# Function to make an outgoing call using Twilio
def make_outgoing_call(to_phone_number):
    """Place an outgoing call to the client and start the qualification process."""
    call = twilio_client.calls.create(
        to=to_phone_number,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        url='http://yourdomain.com/incoming-call'  # This should point to your Flask server
    )
    print(f"Calling {to_phone_number}: {call.sid}")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example to make a call to a client
    make_outgoing_call('+15555555555')  # Replace with the client's phone number

    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation:

    Flask Webhook (/incoming-call):
        This route handles incoming calls and prompts the user to answer a few questions. We use Twilio Voice API to initiate the call.

    Voice Interaction (/handle-response):
        This route captures the user's response (via speech) and uses Dialogflow (or GPT-3) to qualify the lead based on the conversation.

    Lead Qualification (qualify_lead_with_dialogflow):
        This function sends the transcribed speech to Dialogflow to classify the lead as either "qualified" or "unqualified".

    Appointment Scheduling (/schedule-appointment):
        If the lead is qualified, the system schedules an appointment (integrate with Google Calendar or Calendly API).

    Outgoing Call Function (make_outgoing_call):
        This function initiates an outgoing call to the client and starts the qualification process by calling the Twilio API.

Next Steps:

    Google Cloud Setup:
        Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Dialogflow for speech recognition and NLP.

    Integration with Google Calendar or Calendly:
        Integrate with Google Calendar API to schedule appointments dynamically or use Calendly API for a seamless experience.

    Fine-tuning Dialogflow or GPT-3:
        You may need to fine-tune your Dialogflow agent or use GPT-3 for more complex lead qualification conversations.

    Testing & Deployment:
        Test the system with real phone numbers and responses.
        Deploy your Flask app on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for production use.

This will create a voice-based AI system that helps qualify leads and schedule appointments automatically.
